# Automated-Organometallic-Synthesis
This repository contains the files for automated synthesis of europium-based organometallic compounds.

<mark>Automated_synthesis_Eu_90-10vv Formic-water.py</mark> is is the Python protocol needed to be uploaded to an Opentrons Flex robot to reproduce the protocol demonstrated in the paper. Beaker_rack_1_400ml.SLDPRT, Beaker_rack_4_150ml_v2.SLDPRT, Vial_rack_24_4ml_v2.SLDPRT are custom labware which are designed and 3D printed for this project.

CSV files contain information about the amount of material used in each round. They should be read by Opentron Flex during running the protocols.
